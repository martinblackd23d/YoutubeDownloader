# YoutubeDownloader
Short script to download videos/playlists from YouTube, and optionally convert them to MP3

Functionally identical to websites that download videos from YouTube. This way, however, I have more control over which videos I download, and I can download them in bulk.

Used [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) library
